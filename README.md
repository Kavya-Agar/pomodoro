# Pomodoro Timer
Just a basic pomodoro timer that runs locally within the user's computer

## Tech Stack
React + Vite + TypeScript + ElectronJS

## Why?
* It was made because I wanted to learn TypeScript and ElectronJS which were both new to me
* I thought since I get off task really quick and pomodoro timer method has been proven to be a better method to study and focus, why not make my own and learn TS on the side
* Overall, not a big fan of TypeScript, but it was a small project that would've probably been easier with React Native or Python GUI
